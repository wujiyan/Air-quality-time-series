# Air-quality-time-series
This paper interpreted the actual fluctuation of concentration for carbon oxide with measured concentrations for several kinds of gas by an air quality multisensory device and other exogenous variables, and then made predictions for actual CO concentration with several time-series models, MA, ARMA and VAR. Model outputs were compared.  Results obtained include: 1) device measured concentration for CO, NMHC, NOx, NO2 and relative humidity have strong linear relationships with and Granger-cause to actual concentration for CO; 2) ARIMA model reflects more involvement of noise than MA and VAR model on predicting; 3) VAR, ARIMA and MA model are better than linear model on predicting CO concentration. Finally, some analysis on whether to apply these model are offered.
